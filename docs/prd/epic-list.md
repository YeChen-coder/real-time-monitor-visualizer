# **Epic List**

1.  **Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Core Logic**
    * **Goal:** Establish the complete data pipeline from the operating system to the web browser, proving that window titles can be captured and displayed in near real-time. This epic delivers a functional, but visually basic, version of the application.

2.  **Epic 2: Dynamic UI & Visual Polish**
    * **Goal:** Transform the basic display from Epic 1 into the final, aesthetically pleasing product by implementing the "frosted glass" UI, dynamic stacked layout, and fluid animations.
