# **Epic 2: Dynamic UI & Visual Polish - Detailed Stories**

## **Epic Goal**
Transform the functional but basic application from Epic 1 into the final visual design with "frosted glass" morphism effects, dynamic stacking, and fluid animations.

---

## **Story 2.1: Frosted Glass Window Component**

### **Story Overview**
**As a** user,  
**I want** each window to be represented by a "frosted glass" style component,  
**so that** the visualizer has a modern and clean aesthetic.

### **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**

1. **WindowCard Component Creation**
   - Create reusable React component `WindowCard.tsx` in `components/` directory
   - Component accepts window data as props (title, active state, browser info)
   - Component is fully typed with TypeScript interfaces

2. **Frosted Glass Styling**
   - Implement CSS backdrop-filter blur effect for morphism appearance
   - Use semi-transparent backgrounds with proper alpha channels
   - Add subtle border and shadow effects for depth
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility (fallbacks for unsupported browsers)

3. **Typography and Readability**
   - Use clean, modern font (system fonts or web fonts)
   - Ensure high contrast ratio for accessibility
   - Implement text truncation for long window titles
   - Different styling for browser vs application windows

4. **Component Integration**
   - Replace simple list display from Epic 1 with WindowCard components
   - Maintain all existing functionality (active window indication, browser badges)
   - Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes

### **Technical Requirements**
- CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for styling
- Backdrop-filter support with fallbacks
- Accessible design (WCAG AA compliance)
- Performance optimization for multiple cards

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] WindowCard component created and styled with frosted glass effect
- [ ] All window data properly displayed in new component
- [ ] Existing list view completely replaced
- [ ] Visual design matches modern morphism aesthetic
- [ ] Component is responsive and accessible

## **Story 2.2: Dynamic Stack Layout**

### **Story Overview**  
**As a** user,  
**I want** to see the window representations arranged in a dynamic, overlapping stack,  
**so that** there is a clear sense of visual hierarchy and depth.

### **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Absolute Positioning System**
   - Implement CSS absolute positioning for WindowCard components
   - Create container component for managing stack layout
   - Calculate dynamic positions based on window count and active state

2. **Z-Index Management**
   - Active window always has highest z-index (top of stack)
   - Inactive windows layered by recency/importance
   - Smooth z-index transitions during active window changes

3. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Active window: centered, large, fully opaque
   - Recently active windows: slightly offset, medium size
   - Older windows: more offset, smaller, more transparent
   - Maximum of 5-7 visible windows to avoid clutter

4. **Stack Arrangement**
   - Overlapping cards create depth perception
   - Cards arranged in visually pleasing cascade/fan pattern
   - Proper spacing to ensure all cards remain partially visible

### **Technical Requirements**
- CSS transforms for positioning and scaling
- Z-index management system
- Responsive positioning calculations
- Performance considerations for repositioning

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] WindowCard components positioned in dynamic stack
- [ ] Active window prominently displayed at top
- [ ] Inactive windows properly layered behind active window
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clearly represents window importance
- [ ] Stack arrangement is visually appealing and functional

## **Story 2.3: Fluid Animation for Active Window Changes**

### **Story Overview**
**As a** user,  
**I want** the stack of windows to animate smoothly when the active window changes,  
**so that** the experience feels fluid and engaging.

### **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Smooth Transitions**
   - CSS transitions for position, scale, and opacity changes
   - Animation duration ~300-500ms for optimal UX
   - Easing functions for natural motion (ease-out/ease-in-out)

2. **Active Window Animation**
   - New active window smoothly transitions to prominent position
   - Scaling and opacity changes create clear focus shift
   - Z-index changes coordinated with visual transitions

3. **Background Stack Animation**
   - Previously active window smoothly moves to background position
   - Other windows adjust positions to accommodate changes
   - Staggered animations to avoid visual chaos

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use CSS transforms instead of layout properties
   - Hardware acceleration with `will-change` property
   - Debounce rapid window changes to prevent animation conflicts

### **Technical Requirements**
- CSS transitions and transforms
- React state management for animation coordination
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Animation conflict resolution

### **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Smooth animations when active window changes
- [ ] Animation completes within 500ms
- [ ] No visual glitches or conflicts during transitions
- [ ] Animations enhance rather than distract from functionality
- [ ] Good performance with multiple simultaneous animations

## **Story 2.4: Receding History Effect**

### **Story Overview**
**As a** user,  
**I want** previously used windows to recede into the background,  
**so that** I get a sense of my recent activity history.

### **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**

1. **History-Based Styling**
   - Windows styled based on recency of use
   - Progressive reduction in size and opacity
   - Visual cues indicate relative age/importance

2. **Recency Algorithm**
   - Track window activation history
   - Maintain ordered list of recently active windows
   - Limit display to 5-7 most recent windows

3. **Progressive Visual Recession**
   - Most recent: large, prominent, high opacity
   - Moderately recent: medium size, medium opacity  
   - Older: small, low opacity, further back
   - Oldest: barely visible or hidden entirely

4. **History Persistence**
   - Maintain window history across WebSocket reconnections
   - Smart history management (avoid memory leaks)
   - Clear history on window close events

### **Technical Requirements**
- Window history state management
- Dynamic styling calculations
- Memory management for history data
- Integration with WebSocket window data

### **Definition of Done**  
- [ ] Window history tracked accurately
- [ ] Visual recession reflects actual usage recency
- [ ] Display limited to reasonable number of windows
- [ ] History persists appropriately during session
- [ ] Clear visual indication of window age/importance
