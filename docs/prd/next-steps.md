# **Next Steps**

This PRD is now complete. The following prompts are to be used to hand off the project to the next specialists in the workflow.

### **UX Expert Prompt**

"Please review this completed PRD and create the **UI/UX Specification** (`front-end-spec.md`). Your focus should be on detailing the visual and interaction design based on the 'frosted glass' aesthetic, dynamic stacking, and fluid animations specified in the PRD. Define the information architecture (which is simple for this project), user flows, and specific component states required to bring the vision to life."

### **Architect Prompt**

"Please review this completed PRD and the forthcoming UI/UX Specification to create the **Fullstack Architecture Document** (`fullstack-architecture.md`). The key technical constraints and decisions have been made: a Python backend using WebSockets, a React (Vite) frontend, and a monorepo structure. Your task is to create the detailed technical blueprint, including the specific data models to be passed between back and front, the monorepo source tree structure, component interface designs, and the API contract for the WebSocket communication."
