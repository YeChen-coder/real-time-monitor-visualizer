# **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* The application must visually represent open application windows on a local web page.
* The visualization must not expose sensitive window content, ensuring user privacy.
* The web page must be streamable as a source in OBS.
* The application should display the application's name for most windows and the specific tab title for web browsers.
* The display should update in near real-time (allowing for a minor delay of up to 5 seconds).
* The visual style must implement a "frosted glass" (morphism) aesthetic.
* The display must feature a dynamic, overlapping stack layout where the active window is always prominent.

### **Background Context**

Traditional screen sharing is too invasive for body doubling streams, as it risks exposing private or sensitive information like messages, work documents, or personal files. Existing window management tools are not designed for this specific use case, lacking the privacy-preserving visual output needed for OBS integration. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a local web-based visualizer. It will offer an engaging and aesthetic way for streamers to convey their activity and maintain a connection with their audience, without sacrificing privacy. The solution focuses on a "frosted glass" look and a dynamic stacked layout to make the activity feed visually interesting and clear.
